CUPS filter for thermal printer Epson TM-T20II

The linux driver provided on Epson site unfortunately doesn't work.
It is x86 binary and doesn't work on Raspberry Pi.

Filter is provided as src (you can found a list of packages need to be installed in order to build it in the header of source).
Also, printing of blank lines is optimized.

In order to re-compile the binary (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi), the following libraries must be installed:

```
sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev libcupsimage2-dev g++ cups cups-client
```

After that, `make` and `sudo ./install` do the right thing.
